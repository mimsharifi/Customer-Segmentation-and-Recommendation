# Project Description:

This project performs customer segmentation on an e-commerce dataset using clustering techniques, followed by a recommendation system based on the resulting clusters.We aim to segment ecommerce customers into distinct groups based on their purchase behavior. By leveraging clustering algorithms on RFM features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), we will:

* Identify high-value customers for targeted marketing campaigns
* Discover at-risk or low-engagement segments
* Provide actionable insights to improve retention and revenue
